# hello-world
initial git repository

so  cool. I added this text on my computer at 11:45 am on Feb 1, 2019.
now I need to commit the change
 ----
 
 but then, I added this text at 11:47 via the file in GitHub

 ----

 when this happened, I used my GitHub Desktop to first fetch the version that was
 updated remotely - there was no indication of this, so I just need to make a habit of doing that 
 first. It was basically just a refresh action. super quick.

 once that happened, though, I opened up the file on my computer and it had been updated.

 ----
 
 I also need to remember to push the changes (i couldn't note that in the last message because it happens and shows up in the Desktop interface.
 
 The Desktop app helps me stay out of Terminal.
